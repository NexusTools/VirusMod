VirusMod
================================
VirusMod is a **Minecraft Mod** of which introduces different virus variants into the game.

Currently the viruses stem off the idea of bacteria, raw meats and slime causing a rather absurd outcome of a strain of a virus which can cause mass destruction.

Code wise, the main block you place is the "host" of the virus, it's the central hub of which contains the <i>TileEntity</i>, this contains how long it'll last, and the 'logic' of the virus.

Some credits are towards the <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/880935-" target="_blank">BacteriaMod</a> as I initally liked the mods idea and wanted to stem off of it. I in no way intended to copy any of their work and respectfully never used any of their code.
